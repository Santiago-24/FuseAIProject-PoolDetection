# FuseAIProject-PoolDetection
This project is aim to make use of the `YOLOv9 model` for object detection tasks. In particular, a dataset of 100 GPS images containing pools around a certain region has been extracted from `Google Earth Pro` and annotated by using `Label Studio`. In addition, this dataset has been augmented using the library `Albumentations` (in order lo preserve the correct coordinates of the corresponding bounding boxes). The main idea is to create a model capable of detecting and locating the pools present in a certain GPS image.
